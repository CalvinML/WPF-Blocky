# WPF-Blocky

this is a visual programming editor like google blocky and scratch, but implemented by WPF and dotnet. I want to develop a visual programming editor like scratch, but which will be more powerful, and has modern programming feature, like local variable, expandsibility. And I plan to enable it to control the robot toy like Lego Mindstorm EV3. 

currently we wrote this prototype, and achieved the basic function, visualization and execution.
